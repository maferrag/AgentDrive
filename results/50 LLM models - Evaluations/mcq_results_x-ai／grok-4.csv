The ego must stop before the red light at x = -100.0 without violating the signal. Given reduced traction and the risk of rear-end collision, what should be the ego's highest priority?",Maintain current speed to avoid being rear-ended,Match the aggressive vehicle's deceleration exactly,"Begin immediate, controlled braking to ensure stop at the light",Accelerate to pass the aggressive vehicle before it cuts in
