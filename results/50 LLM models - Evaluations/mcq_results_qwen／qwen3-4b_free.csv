A lead car suddenly brakes hard at 30 seconds, reducing traction and visibility further. Given the high risk of skidding and limited escape options, what minimum time gap should the ego vehicle maintain to the lead vehicle during the lane change, based on conservative safety policy for adverse conditions?",1.0 second,1.5 seconds,2.0 seconds,3.0 seconds

Assume a driver reaction time of 1.5 seconds and maximum deceleration of 3 m/s² on ice. What is the minimum safe braking distance needed to avoid a red light violation, assuming the lead vehicle becomes a stationary obstacle after the driver's reaction?",129.63 m,172.25 m,144.44 m,96.45 m

Traffic is aggressive and weaving. Which maneuver minimizes collision risk while ensuring a full stop?,Brake gently and early,Accelerate to pass before red,Change lanes to avoid traffic,Maintain speed until stop line
