A merging vehicle will decelerate sharply into the middle lane, and a red light cycles ahead at x = -50.0. Pedestrian jaywalking adds unpredictability near the intersection. Which maneuver best balances collision risk, TTC, and signal compliance?",Accelerate to complete the lane change before 20 seconds,Delay lane change and maintain current speed,Brake early to allow merging vehicle to cut safely,Change lanes immediately and decelerate in the left lane

Performing the U-turn too late risks crossing the stop line at high speed, while doing it too early may reduce stability on flooded pavement. Which maneuver minimizes collision risk and avoids red light violation?",Accelerate to 100 km/h before initiating the U-turn,Maintain 80 km/h and begin U-turn at x = -75.0,Brake to 40 km/h and initiate U-turn near x = -60.0,Perform an immediate U-turn at x = -100.0
