You must navigate the turn while avoiding sudden maneuvers. Which maneuver minimizes collision risk given the gravel surface and merging threat?",Brake moderately to increase headway,Accelerate slightly to create space ahead,Change lanes away from the merging car,Maintain current speed and position
